# Part 2: My Programming Journey - Why I Keep Coding

When I began my journey, I was a credit analyst, so programming or coding wasn't in the job description. It wasn't even requested by management; it was just something I thought would help increase my efficiency.

It did help, and I could have stopped there. Once you've written, debugged, and refactored Python for a specific task, you're usually done. But for me, that was just the start. I fell in love with programming. The problem-solving was amazing and suited my personality perfectly.

After a while, I discovered the open-source world. My goodness, the dedication of the people who come together and spend hours programming these systems, just to have their code audited or freely used in some cases, fascinated me. So, I dove in and learned more about contributing to these types of projects.

Fast forward a few years, and I've transitioned into a new professional role as Director of IT. I've learned a few new programming languages and have decided on a path forward. I'll primarily search GitHub for issues in any of the languages I know or plan to learn. I'll update this blog with contribution details, updates on my programming journey, and any additional projects that come my way.

Until next time...
