# Part 1: My Programming Journey: Exploring Different Languages

**Hello, World!**
This simple sentence marks the start of many programmers' journeys. For me, it was Python. I used it at work for data entry and manipulation. Have you ever seen how long it takes to open an Excel spreadsheet with thousands of rows of data? This small irritation was enough to push me to learn Python sufficiently to perform the tasks I needed.

Later, I discovered that coding was actually enjoyable. I decided to work with Django and Flask to build a few self-hosted webpages. I then transitioned to using Go as my language of choice. Primarily, I developed desktop applications using the Fyne framework. I still use Go for most "general" programming when possible, primarily due to its garbage collection capabilities.

Next, I explored Rust. To be frank, I tried Rust on and off a few times, but handling memory was a challenging concept for me. I can navigate it better now, but I still prefer languages with a garbage collector.

As for JavaScript and TypeScript, they are simply part and parcel of web development.

Stay tuned for **Part 2**, where I will discuss future plans and why I have chosen to continue coding on the side.
