      Beyond coding, I'm passionate about fishing, golfing, or anything that gets my in nature.
      An odd hobby of mine is to bird watch or sit and listen to birds while reading a book.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm font-light">
      While I have some preferred tools, I always choose the best one for the
      job, even if it's not on my usual list. My goal is to find the right
      solution for each project.
